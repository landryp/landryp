## Hello!

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (University of Toronto).

I develop and apply data-driven statistical methods to learn about the universe's black holes and neutron stars. I use gravitational-wave observations of these dead stars to answer fundamental questions about nuclear physics, strong gravity and the history of the cosmos.
