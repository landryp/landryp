## Hello!

**I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (University of Toronto).** I develop and apply data-driven statistical methods to learn about the universe's black holes and neutron stars. I use gravitational wave observations of these dead stars to answer fundamental questions about nuclear physics, strong gravity and the history of the cosmos.

### Projects

* [bns-dtd-rproc](https://github.com/landryp/bns-dtd-rproc) - *bayesian inference of the binary neutron star delay time distribution from galactic r-process abundance observations, and hypothesis testing on one vs two-channel models for galactic r-process enrichment history*
* [twin-stars](https://github.com/landryp/twin-stars/tree/gwbench) - *hierarchical inference of a parameterized hybrid-star equation of state with simulated next-generation binary neutron star merger observations, and hypothesis testing on the existence of twin stars in the population*
* [mock-bns-pop](https://github.com/landryp/mock-bns-pop) - *simulate a binary neutron star merger population and calculate Fisher matrix parameter uncertainties*
* [em-dash](https://github.com/landryp/em-dash) - *visualization of remnant matter predictions for compact binary mergers*
